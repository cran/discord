`discord` is an R package that provides functions for discordant kinship
modeling and other sibling-based quasi-experimental designs. It includes
functions for data preparation, regression analysis, and simulation of
genetically-informed data. The package is designed to facilitate the
implementation of discordant sibling designs in research, allowing for
the control of shared familial confounding factors.

Visit the [discord website](https://r-computing-lab.github.io/discord/)
for more information and detailed documentation. Below is a brief
overview of the package, its features, and a roadmap to get you started.

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Install the Package

``` r
# Install from CRAN
install.packages('discord')

# Or install development version from GitHub
# install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('R-Computing-Lab/discord')
```

### Step 2: Choose Your Starting Point

Your workflow depends on your data structure and experience level:

**🚀 New to discordant-kinship regression?**

- Start with [Full Data
  Workflow](https://r-computing-lab.github.io/discord/articles/full_data_workflow.html)
- Demonstrates complete end-to-end example for beginners
- Transforms data from wide, long, or pedigree formats
- Selects siblings for OLS and orders for discordant analysis
- Shows all three models (OLS, Between-Family, Discordant) side-by-side
- Includes equations, manually specified syntax, as well as function
  calls

**📊 Have NLSY data or existing kinship links?**

- Use [NLSY Regression
  Analysis](https://r-computing-lab.github.io/discord/articles/regression.html)
- Real-world example with flu vaccination and SES data
- Complete workflow from kinship linking to interpretation

**🔧 Need to build kinship links from scratch?**

- See [Using discord with Simple Family
  Structures](https://r-computing-lab.github.io/discord/articles/links.html)
- Construct links from basic family IDs (mother, father)
- Works without pre-existing kinship databases

### Step 3: Explore Advanced Topics

Once you understand the basics, explore specialized topics:

- **Categorical predictors**: [Categorical Predictors
  Vignette](https://r-computing-lab.github.io/discord/articles/categorical_predictors.html)
- **Visualizing results**: [Plotting
  Vignette](https://r-computing-lab.github.io/discord/articles/plots.html)
- **Sample size planning**: [Power Analysis
  Vignette](https://r-computing-lab.github.io/discord/articles/Power.html)

## Package Features

- **Data Preparation**: Functions to prepare and structure data for
  discordant sibling analysis, including handling of kinship pairs and
  demographic variables.
- **Regression Analysis**: Tools to perform discordant regression
  analyses, allowing for the examination of within-family effects while
  controlling for shared familial confounders.
- **Simulation**: Functions to simulate genetically-informed data,
  enabling researchers to test and validate their models.

## Complete Vignette Roadmap

The package includes several vignettes organized by user needs. All
vignettes can be accessed
[online](https://r-computing-lab.github.io/discord/articles/) or from
the RStudio “Vignettes” tab after package installation.

### 📚 Start Here: Core Workflows

These vignettes provide complete end-to-end examples and should be your
first stop:

- [Full data workflow for
  discord](https://r-computing-lab.github.io/discord/articles/full_data_workflow.html)
  - **What you’ll learn:**
    - How to transform data from wide, long, or pedigree formats
    - How to select siblings for standard OLS regression
    - How to discord orders siblings for discordant-kinship analysis
    - How to run and compare all three model types (OLS, Between-Family,
      Discordant)
      - including specify models using equations, manual syntax, and
        function calls
    - How to interpret difference scores and mean scores
    - Complete side-by-side model comparisons
- [NLSY regression analysis with
  discord](https://r-computing-lab.github.io/discord/articles/regression.html)
  - Use this vignette if you want an end-to-end applied example that
    links NLSY79 relatives, cleans variables for flu vaccination and
    SES, constructs dyads, and then fits within-family models.
  - You will learn how to specify discord_regression correctly and
    interpret coefficients.

### 🔧 Data Preparation

- [No Database? No Problem: Using discord with simple family
  Structures](https://r-computing-lab.github.io/discord/articles/links.html)
  - This vignette is particularly useful for situations when you do not
    have existing kinship links and need to build relationships directly
    from simple family identifiers.
  - It shows how to construct the links, optionally simulate phenotypes
    under specified structures, and fit discord_regression with
    alternative specifications for small or bespoke datasets.

### 📊 Advanced Topics

- [Creating plots for
  discord](https://r-computing-lab.github.io/discord/articles/plots.html)
  - This vignette takes fitted discord_regression outputs and produces
    publication-ready ggplot figures of effect estimates and
    within-family contrasts with minimal transformation of the model
    results.
  - It includes complete plotting code paths you can reuse, from
    extracting estimates to saving figures that clearly communicate
    within-family findings.
- [Power Analysis with
  discord](https://r-computing-lab.github.io/discord/articles/power.html)
  - Use this vignette when you need to plan sample sizes or evaluate
    power by running simulation grids that vary effect sizes, kin types,
    and Ns using kinsim, then re-fitting discord_regression under each
    condition. It reports empirical power and writes tidy summaries.
- [Handling categorical predictors with
  discord](https://r-computing-lab.github.io/discord/articles/categorical_predictors.html)
  - This vignette formalizes categorical predictors in discord designs
    by separating categorical variables into within-dyad and
    between-dyad components. It makes the implied contrasts explicit.  
  - It discusses the pitfalls of interpreting coefficients when using
    categorical predictors, and reviews best practices for coding and
    interpretation.
